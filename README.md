##Intro
Created by Jaime Meyer Beilis Michel
Since October 2024, at the  University Arizona.
This project was created for the class CSC210, for the FALL 2024 semester.
This project is an adaptation of the previous project, but it implements a GUI utilizing javaFX.


##Input - Output

*Input from file*
An example input from a file would be comprised by the following text.


```
    rows: 2
    cols: 2
    delay: 1.2
    

    PLANT (3,4) daisy

```

The output gathered from the file is a GUI that displays utilizing squares, the representation of 
distinct plant types
